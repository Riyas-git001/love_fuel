## Basic Details
### Team Name: Useless!!! 

### Team Members

### Project Description
An interactive and fun web app designed to help couples keep their conversations alive, avoid awkward silences, and add some humor to their chats. Includes random prompts, roasts, and quirky challenges â€” all from the mind of a single creator.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
For couples that are struggling to talk, sometimes the conversation just dies â€” but not on our watch.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a random conversation spark generator with categories like:
- Roast your partner
- Deep confession
- Would you ratherâ€¦
- Past life guess
- Cute dares
- Awkward silence breakers
